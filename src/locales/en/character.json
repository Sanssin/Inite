    "intro": "Hello! I'm \"Rekta\", your radiation guide. My name is a combination of \"Reactor\" and \"Energy\" (Tenaga), two very important things in the nuclear world. I'm a robot specifically designed to accompany you in exploring the radiation zone safely.",
    "mission": "My main mission is to be your 'eyes and ears'. I'm equipped with a dosimeter to measure the total radiation exposure you receive and a survey meter to determine the dose rate around you. Together, we will learn to apply the most important radiation protection principles: \"Time, Distance, and Shielding\".",
    "funFactTitle": "Did You Know?",
    "funFact": "My inspiration comes from research reactors in Indonesia that are used for research and production of radioisotopes for medical and industrial purposes. Just like reactor energy that must be managed carefully, I will help you manage radiation exposure as low as possible!",
